## Setup

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
2. Once you have Git installed, go ahead and git clone this [adsl-dev repo](https://github.com/yubose/adsl-dev)
3. Start up a local testing server with [index.html](hyuge_com/index.html) as your root file by using a local server tool of your choice.

   With [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/):
    - Search and install VSCode extension - [Live Server by Ritwick]
        (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
        This extension will be used to start up the local testing server.
    - "Live Server"
   - Once you have these installed,
      - "open fold"  at .../hyuge_com
      - right click on the [index.html](hyuge_com/index.html) and click on "Open with Live Server." The local server should open on port 5500.
       Your browser should automatically open http://127.0.0.1:5500/hyuge_com/index.html, but if not go to the url and you should see the website homepage.

     - There are various advantages on using a local server as opposed to opening the index.html file in your browser as explained here <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/set_up_a_local_testing_server>. Some other local server tools can be found here as well if you wish to use something else.
